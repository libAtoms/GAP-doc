QUIP and quippy documentation
=============================

The ``QUIP`` package (`GitHub <https://github.com/libAtoms/QUIP>`_) is a
collection of software tools to carry out molecular dynamics
simulations. It implements a variety of interatomic potentials and
tight binding quantum mechanics, and is also able to call external
packages, and serve as plugins to other software such as `LAMMPS
<http://lammps.sandia.gov>`_, `CP2K <http://www.cp2k.org>`_ and also
the python framework `ASE <https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase>`_.  Various
hybrid combinations are also supported in the style of QM/MM, with a
particular focus on materials systems such as metals and
semiconductors.

``quippy`` is a Python interface to ``QUIP`` that provides deep access to
most of the Fortran types and routines. The quippy interface is principally
maintained by `James Kermode <http://www.warwick.ac.uk/jrkermode>`_.

Long term support of the package is ensured by:
 - Noam Bernstein (Naval Research Laboratory)
 - Gabor Csanyi (University of Cambridge)
 - James Kermode (University of Warwick)

Overview of ``libAtoms`` and ``QUIP``
-------------------------------------

- The `libAtoms <http://www.libatoms.org>`_ package is a software
  library written in Fortran 95 for the purposes of carrying out
  molecular dynamics simulations.

- The ``QUIP`` (**QU**\ antum mechanics and **I**\ nteratomic
  **P**\ otentials) package, built on top of ``libAtoms``, implements a
  wide variety of interatomic potentials and tight binding quantum
  mechanics, and is also able to call external packages.

- Various hybrid combinations are also supported in the style of
  QM/MM, including `Learn on the Fly` scheme [LOTF]_

- `quippy <http://www.jrkermode.co.uk/quippy>`_ is a Python interface
  to libAtoms and QUIP.
